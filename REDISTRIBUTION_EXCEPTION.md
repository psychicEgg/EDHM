# Redistribution Exception

**EDHM** is normally distributed under a restrictive license allowing **personal use only** unless explicit permission is granted by the copyright holder.

## Exception for Nixpkgs

I, Fred89210, copyright holder of **EDHM**, hereby grant **explicit permission** for EDHM to be redistributed **only as part of the EDHM-UI package** in the [Nixpkgs repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).

- This permission applies **solely to redistribution of EDHM as part of EDHM-UI**, not as a standalone package.  
- All copyright notices and license terms of EDHM must remain intact.  
- This permission is **revocable at any time** by the copyright holder.  

Outside of this specific exception, the original license of EDHM (“personal use only unless otherwise agreed”) fully applies.
