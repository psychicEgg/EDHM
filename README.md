## **Elite Dangerous HUD Mod**

**ALERT 7 August 2024:** New Version of EDHM for Odyssey for FDev U18.08!

HUGE Thank you to CMDRs Fred89210 for keeping EDHM alive! Expect updates via [EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases/latest).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FDev U18.08 Update has made changes to Orbit Lines, making them thicker to reduce the hatching effect.

Due to these changes, the Thick Orbit Lines Mod no longer works, and an update will be necessary when it becomes available.

Unfortunately, FDev has introduced a bug that causes Orbit Lines to not always be hidden correctly when disabled in-game (some visible lines on the screen when attempting to disable them are not hidden and start moving).
The solution is to disable the lines when they are not visible, such as when in normal flight.

Until FDev fixes this issue, I offer you a temporary 3PMod that allows you to use a keyboard shortcut to enable/disable the Orbit Lines Shader, which will effectively hide them without encountering this problem.

**Announcement:** As of late March 2023, I have retired from Elite. It has been an incredible 2.5 years developing EDHM, and this experience has inspired me to change careers and pursue programming. 

For more information, please see my posts on the Frontier Forums: the [Main EDHM thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-dangerous-hud-mod-edhm.557033/) and [my retirement post](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/cmdrs-it-has-been-a-privilege.615656/).

Moving forward, I have entrusted the entire source code to the dedicated EDHM Discord team, whom I've known for a long time. I hope they will continue to update EDHM and keep it running smoothly. As I can no longer provide support for the mod, I recommend you join the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/KTYgJegfYw) if you have any questions or concerns.

For any UI-related issues, please seek out **Blue Mystic** (EDHM UI admin), and for mod updates, reach out to **CMDR Fred89210** (Chief Modder) or **Rico Brzenska** (Theme modder; she/her).

Thank you for all your support, and good hunting CMDRs!

PS. I will continue to post mod updates here as soon as they are released by the EDHM team.

### Odyssey
I'm very pleased to announce EDHM for Odyssey is now available. Unlike the Horizons version of EDHM, you can set custom RGB colours for every element on the HUD, and ship / station / carrier panels.

Due to the complexity of the Odyssey version, I recommend you use EDHM UI (developed by Blue Mystic) to install and configure the mod

[EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases)

Please note: EDHM UI will install both the mod **and** the UI, you don't need to download anything else.

[EDHM UI Installation Guide](https://bluemystical.github.io/edhm-api/)

As EDHM for Odyssey is still in development, I recommend you join us on the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/KTYgJegfYw) where you can find the latest updates, new player-created themes, and general support

### Horizons 3.8

Latest version for Horizons 3.8: v1.52b (December 26, 2021)

[v1.52b Download Link](https://github.com/psychicEgg/EDHM/tree/main/Releases/v1.52)

If you prefer not to configure the mod manually (in a text editor) then please use [EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases)

EDHM for Horizons 3.8 is no longer being developed as I don't have time to work on both versions. However, it's still a good mod with lots of options.
