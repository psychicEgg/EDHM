Hey CMDRs,

I managed to intercept a transmission from the Pilot's Federation with an update to their Radar display on the HUD.

Even better, we have the raw code so we can alter the colours and different aspects of the radar according to our preferences.

This package contains:

- Two shader files (the radar in normal flight, and the radar in supercruise).
Backup your shader files in the ShaderFixes folder, then copy the two new radar shaders into the ShaderFixes folder.
	i. ba58bc885c2dac25-ps.txt
	ii. f27049cc4a93e1f2-ps.txt

- A calibration table (very approximate) for choosing your colours. Open in Excel or Google Sheets.

- A Template that indexes the locations in the shader files to make your changes.


In the future we will have an EDHM UI app that will allow you to make these changes by clicking on a colour wheel and pressing 'save',
but for now you'll need to make these changes manually.

Making changes is best used in combination with the special reload function (so you don't have to exit Elite to see your changes),
please see the GitHib for the code (in the Shaders (ASM) folder):
