## EDHM v21.00 for Elite Dangerous v4.2.0.3 Patch Notes

### -- Ready for Elite Dangerous v4.2.0.3 (Vanguards Update) --<br><br>

**EDHM v21.00:**
- First Fix for Elite Dangerous v4.2.0.2 (Vanguards Update)
  - Fix Orange Elements and other problems caused by Vanguards Update
  - NEW: New Squadron Menu Color Mode *(Cyan Elite Default or XML)* (y229)
  - NEW: The HoloMe Menu is now modded and therefore takes on the XML Color
  
If the New Squadron Menu mod turns out to be problematic, it may be changed or even removed in a future update.

NOTE: Since I don't have access to a Squadron Carrier *(SFC)*, it's impossible for me to mod SFC-related items, so you might find some unmodded items in your SFC menus. These menus may be modded in the future if I obtain an SFC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FDev have made many changes with Vanguards Update, so if you notice any remaining orange elements after the update, please let me know where they are and send me a screenshot in the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/KTYgJegfYw)

I recommend you join us on the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/KTYgJegfYw) where you can find the latest updates, new player-created themes, and general support.
