## EDHM 14.04 & 14.05 Patch Notes

- Small update to fix the Blinding Blob 'feature' that sometimes appears during the rotating loading screen holo sequence

- Added the [Loader] section to d3dx.ini for people who want to use OpenComposite for VR

- Added the ability to use a keybind to toggle Sunglasses Mode 😎  (bloom on / off)

- Fixed Galmap textures that broke in FDev 14.02

- Added colour options for Damaged Stations on GalMap (previously was only Custom)

- Converted most 'Thargoid effects on Station' icons on the Targeting Panel (Lower left)

    Note: I have to fly around to capture each combination of station type and thargoid status, and sometimes there's more than one version (I currently have about 25 versions)
    
    If you see an orange (unmodded) Thargoid status symbol on the station icon can you please let me know:<br>
        - the system and station name (or just a screenshot)<br>
        - your game resolution
    
    Note: I haven't done the versions above 1440p (inclusive of supersampling), will update as I find them (no need to report these hi-res versions)

- Added an option to choose the colour for the Combat Zone (CZ) panels (top right Info Panel)
    Note: This colour will also affect the background of the Thargoid frame on the Targeting Panel (bottom left)
    Will also affect the target ship's subcomponents bar

- Fixed a glitch on some Concourse Terminal Monitors. Please let me know if the fix breaks anything

Good hunting!
