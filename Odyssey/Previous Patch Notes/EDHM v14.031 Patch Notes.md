Hi CMDRs,

This is the third and final update and fix for Odyssey FDev v14.01

I've tried to include as many of your suggestions as possible, but please let me know if there's still any orange or bugs, thanks


__Patch notes:__

- Squashed all orange including FDev U14.01

- Galmap icons: Elite default mode will make them all default

- Galmap: Added custom colour option for Damaged Stations

- Galmap: Modded the new icons on the system description panel

- Restored Galmap fog options

- Shield % and text around radar should display correctly in XML mode

- Fixed ship name background to take the correct colour in XML mode

- Fixed radar for data link scanning and ECM

- Fixed asteroid outlines on the radar

- Fixed CQC rank text for French language (merci CMDR Fred89210 !)

- Fixed Station terminals intro screen

- Fixed Codex elements and icons

- FSS/DSS mods should be fully working now (not the overlay, that's next)

**New Additions**


- Added XML text override, to make ALL your text XML

- Added a more colourful glitching HUD mode (optional) when taking damage, especially from thargoids
