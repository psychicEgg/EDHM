Hi CMDRs,

This is **EDHM Update v13.51 for Odyssey & H4.0**. It contains a few bug fixes and several new options.

I've decided to remove the 'beta' status as the mod feels pretty stable now. Having said that I've probably jinxed it ðŸ™‚
<br><br><br>
<ins>Fixes:</ins>

- When winged, the neutral target rhombus was taking the missile lock colour. It should now correctly display your chosen colour. Let me know if there's still any problems with this

- Fixed a bug with the thargoid interceptor hearts display. The hearts should glow red when exerted
<br><br><br>

<ins>Additions:</ins>

- Added the **Dank Rank mod**. Many players have been asking FDev for years to turn off or remove their CQC rank from the ship panel. Displaying the lowest CQC rank in bright red blemishes otherwise great achievements.

You can now choose the colour of the CQC Rank Elements and the rank boxes

There is also a separate brightness control for the CQC Rank Text, if you want to turn off the rank completely

This mod was quite difficult to make as it's on a tabbed panel. If you notice any glitches please let me know

- Added mod of the FSD Cooldown animation and Escape Vector

The graphic for the Escape Vector may jump around the shader .. if you see it as default blue can you please let me know where you were launching from, and your Materials Quality setting, thanks

- Added separate brightness controls to radar objects: Squares, lines/stalks, and coasters
Note: To prevent breaking every theme in the UI, I added a failsafe within the shader. This means if you set the brightness to 0 it will revert to 1.0


- Added separate colour modes for the mouse dot (previously it was lumped in with all the combat reticles)


- Added an optional fix for the Ambient Cabin Lighting for ships with a long nose / set back cockpit (eg. FDL)

The lighting should now cover all orange lighting. However, this makes the primary colour more dominant, so I added an option to keep the legacy lighting style (primary colour less dominant) if you prefer


- The main ship artwork on the Carrier / Station panels will now take the custom colour you use for the ship sketch on the Advanced Maintenance Panel

<ins>Removed:</ins>

- Removed the Non-sequence star highlight on the GalMap. This function is being moved to a new 3PM Stellar Class GalMap mod

Good hunting
