# Orbit Lines Keybind v0.01.0 for Elite Dangerous 4.0 Update 18.07

### by CMDR Fred89210<br><br>

**-- NEW for FDev U18.07 --**<br><br>

**Release Notes:**
- Initial Release

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Description:**

An alternative to enable/disable Orbit Lines.

Note that for the mod to work, Orbit Lines must first be enabled in-game.

By default, the keyboard shortcut is NUMPAD 0, but you can replace it in the EDHM_UI Plugins Menu.

Within the menu, you can also select whether to display or hide the lines when launching the game.

This mod will be removed when FDev has resolved the issue.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FDev U18.07 Update has made changes to Orbit Lines, making them thicker to reduce the hatching effect.

Due to these changes, the Thick Orbit Lines Mod no longer works, and an update will be necessary when it becomes available.

Unfortunately, FDev has introduced a bug that causes Orbit Lines to not always be hidden correctly when disabled in-game (some visible lines on the screen when attempting to disable them are not hidden and start moving).
The solution is to disable the lines when they are not visible, such as when in normal flight.

Until FDev fixes this issue, I offer you a temporary 3PMod that allows you to use a keyboard shortcut to enable/disable the Orbit Lines Shader, which will effectively hide them without encountering this problem. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to use:**

With EDHM_UI:

Go to `Main Menu -> 3PMods -> Orbit Lines Keybind` and Enable/Disable Orbit Lines or change the Key.<br><br>

Without EDHM_UI:

Edit `OrbitLinesKeybind.ini` and change the line `NUMPAD0`.
