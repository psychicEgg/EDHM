**Description:**

This is an optional overlay for your FSS that every explorer should have.

The FSS Overlay mod adds an informational overlay on top of the Filtered Spectral Analysis, and indicates what type of celestial bodies fall within a particular frequency band.<br>

The Mod offers several excellent Overlays created by the community.

Don't hesitate to tell us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KTYgJegfYw) if you want to design your own overlay and we will help you integrate it into the Mod.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to use:**

With EDHM_UI:

Go to `Main Menu -> 3PMods -> FSS-Overlay`. Here you can adjust the mod.

Without EDHM_UI:

Edit `FSS-Overlay.ini`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: For all requests for modifications/corrections concerning existing Overlays, please contact the Overlay author via the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/KTYgJegfYw). Only the Overlay authors possess the original files of their Overlays.

**For modders, I've added full comments to the shader code so it can be updated or improved without my input.**

Good (planet) hunting! o7<br>
