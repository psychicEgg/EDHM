**-- Fixed for Elite Dangerous 4.2.0.2 --**<br><br>

**Release Notes:**
- Fixed For Elite Dangerous 4.2.0.2
- Improvement for EDHM-UI v3

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Description:**

Since the release of Odyssey I've received many requests for a Mod of the Biome Overlay.

The Default Overlay has a Background of Blue, and a Biome Target colour of slightly more Greeny-Blue - it's not surprising it can be very difficult to distinguish between the two layers, especially for CMDRs with visual difficulties.<br><br>

**The options are quite basic:**
- Elite Default
- Method 1: Custom Target Colour (Choose your own colour for the Target Biome Layer)
- Method 2: Custom Target Colour plus visible terrain (The Blue Background is turned off. Makes it easier to find an area to land with adequate light.)

There's also an optional keybind to cycle through the overlay modes. Sometimes it can be easier to see the biome in Method 1, then use Method 2 to choose your landing spot.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION:**

It's important to note that not all planets have a Perfect Biome, in which case the custom color will not appear, you will only see the Original Blue.<br><br>

**Note:** It's impossible to have a different colour for each type of Biome as the shader doesn't receive that information.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to use:**

With EDHM_UI:

Go to `Main Menu -> 3PMods -> Enhanced Biome Overlay`. Here you can adjust the mod.

Without EDHM_UI:

Edit `BiomeOverlay.ini`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a particularly difficult mod, so please report any bugs to the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/KTYgJegfYw), thank you.

**I've commented the shader files in case anyone would like to expand on the mod (or fix it faster than I can after the next update 🙂).**<br>
