## To install 3PMs

**3PM zip files are located in this GitHub folder.**<br><br>

**With [EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases) (recommended):**

Most 3PMs are available for direct download from EDHM_UI, go to `Main Menu -> 3PMods` and search for the desired mod.

If the mod is displayed, click on it and accept the installation. (This works the same way to install updates for 3PMs)

If the desired mod does not appear in the EDHM_UI list, follow the instructions below:
- Exit Elite
- Download the 3PM `.zip` file and save it anywhere you want
- In EDHM UI go to `Main Menu -> 3PMods`
- At the bottom toolbar, click 'Import Mod' and select the `.zip` you downloaded
- Configure via EDHM_UI, `Main Menu -> 3PMods`<br><br>

**Manually (only if you understand the structure of the mod):**
 - Exit Elite
 - Save the `.zip` file in the game folder (usually elite-dangerous-odyssey-64)
 - Ensure the `ShaderFixes` and `EDHM-ini` folders exist in the game folder (where you saved the `.zip` file). They are the mod folders, if you don't see them you're in the wrong folder.
 - Unzip the contents, and press `OK` to merge existing folders, overwrite old files
 - Configure via the `.ini` files in the `\EDHM-ini\3rdPartyMods` folder
 - Uninstall by double-clicking the corresponding `.bat` file (for example, `CockpitLights.bat`) in the `\EDHM-ini\3rdPartyMods` folder (make sure Elite is closed!)
