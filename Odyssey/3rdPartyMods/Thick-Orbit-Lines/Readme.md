**Release Notes:**
- Ready for for Elite Dangerous 4.1.0.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that this mod is still in beta testing.

If you encounter any issues, please report them on the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/KTYgJegfYw).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Description:**

Ever wanted to make your orbit lines thicc? 

With this Mod you can increase the Glow and Width of your Orbit / Gravity Well / Exclusion Zone Lines (in addition to setting their colour and brightness in the Main Mod EDHM).<br>

The effect applies to all types of lines (Orbit, Gravity Well, Exclusion Zone) as they can't be separated in this particular shader.

Please note: FDev never intended for the Orbit Lines to be stretched, so they have a crosshatch pattern in the middle - it's not a bug, it's a feature. 🙂<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to use:**

With EDHM_UI:

Go to `Main Menu -> 3PMods -> Thick Orbit Lines Mod`. Here you can adjust the mod.

Without EDHM_UI:

Edit `ThickOrbitLines.ini`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have Fun! o7<br>
