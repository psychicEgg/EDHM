**Description:**

This mod turns off the Holograms of Landing Pads, SRV Entrance and On Foot Entrance and can hide the Tire Tracks of the SRV.
It is also possible to turn off some Spotlights.

When the `Show Mod Status` option is activated, the Ship Hologram (in the middle of the shield) turns off when turning off the Outer Holograms. (this option is disabled by default)

The mod allows you to turn off the three elements separately (Holograms, Tire Tracks, Spotlights) using a Keyboard Shortcut.
It is advisable to leave the Holograms activated when flying otherwise you will not see the location of your Pad.<br>
