## <ins>EDHM v1.52 for Elite Dangerous 3.8 Horizons Legacy</ins>

It's been eons since Horizons was last updated!

As you know, FDev Update 9 delivered many broken icons in both Ody and Horizons.

This 1.52 update for Horizons fixes those orange icons.

It also allows any 'Disable GUI Effects' setting in Elite's graphics options.

I've also updated the Manual to reflect this change, and encouraged CMDRs to use [EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI) to install and customise the mod.

EDHM for Elite Dangerous Horizons Legacy 3.8 is no longer being developed. However, it's still a good mod with lots of options.
